For Look smoother rounded shape Donut press `Right Button` on mouse then click on `Shade Smooth`, 
this is low poly but appear high resolution or high polys.

or

You use Subdivision Modifiers.

Select object(Donut), Click on Modifiers > Add modifiers > Generate > Subdivision surface.

In Case after you add modifier, if donut does not apper on viewport then trying to disable GPU subdivision, here how,

Edit > Viewport > Subdivsion > GPU Subdivision

Play with Levels ViewPort and Render , Keep Shade Smooth On, and, keep ViewPort and Render 1 for this Donut project.

Now change Object Mode to Edit Mode, Square are called faces. 
black dots or points are called vertex and more then one is called vertices,
and line between two vertices is called edge. if four vertices and 4 edges forming a square is called a face.

HOTkey for change between mode is `TAB` Edit or Object Mode.

Move some vertices at a time use Proportional Editing,

select vertex then in header region enable Proportional Editing then move cursor, you can change cicle of influence by
scroll wheel up and down or using page up/down.
